# Swoogo Capture â€“ Registrant Evidence Collector

This project automates capturing **registrant evidence** from Swoogo:

- Attendance Status / Proof  
- Contact Details  
- Ticket & Email Delivery (full email iframe)  
- QR Code Ticket Email  
- Confirmation Page  
- Invoice Page  

Each registrantâ€™s evidence is collected into its own folder, zipped, and uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage**.  
The local directory is then deleted (to save disk space).
